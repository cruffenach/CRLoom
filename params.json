{"name":"CRLoom","tagline":"Core Data Threading Made Easy","body":"## Introduction\r\nCRLoom is an unobtrusive framework for easing the pains of moving your Core Data interactions off of the main thread.\r\n\r\n### Motivations\r\nWhen creating iOS applications, I regularly would make calls to web services, be delivered a collection of objects and need to create or update objects in my `NSManagedObjectContext` with the data. Commonly I would do this on the main thread and would notice my tableviews stutter, or for very large collections even freeze for a moment or two. To solve this I began doing my collection import work off of the main thread. I have generalized some of the patterns I used to move off the main thread into `CRLoom`, an unobtrusive framework for easing the pains of Core Data threading.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
